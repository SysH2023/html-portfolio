<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Thanks for visiting my website! My name is Sysouphanh (C-Su-Pon) and I’m originally from Laos.</p> 

<p>My family came from a poor rural countryside of Laos with full of sunshine, green mountains, farm fields, and exotic fruits that were rare and expensive. 
When my mom was pregnant of me, she would always crave for apples that weren’t affordable at the time, so she literally nicknamed me, Apun (apple)!</p>
  
<p>Initially, there were seven girls and two boys in our family. From what I can recall, my mom had really tough times raising all nine kids on her own with my grandmother (her mother) help while my dad was a way to serve in the Viet Cong’s Camp. 
So, she had to split up some of us children to go live with our aunties for several years until my dad’s return from the camp. My mom also sent my oldest brother to America first, in hope that he could find great job in order to support the rest of us younger siblings. 
Unfortunately, that never panned out the way my mom had anticipated.</p>
  
<p>In the early 1980’s, upon my dad’s return from the communist camp after 10 plus years of being away from the family. My parents abruptly decided that we should escape the country in order for us to have a better life in America. 
Without much of a strategic plan in mind, in caveat, my dad would have to escape first because if in any case the Communists found out of my dad’s plan; he would be killed in the process. 
Since we so poor, we weren’t able to afford to escape by air planes or a big boat where we all could fit and leave at the same time. Instead, we had to flee by a small canoe with only four people at a time crossing the Mekong River, 
which splits between Thailand and Laos. So, it was my dad, two older sisters, and I survived the first round and made it safely to Refugee Camp in Thailand. 
Fast forward to the third and last round, my mom, one younger, and older sisters were drowned too death via an intentional canoe capsized incident.</p>
  
<p>So finally, in 1986, the remaining five of us have made it to the US and joined with my oldest brother, but have not yet been back to Laos since.</p>
